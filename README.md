#Multisite Menu Widget
###For Wordpress Multisite

This plugin registers a widget that can be used on sub-sites to select and display menus from the primary site. 

Offers a drop down to select any menu that is registered using `wp_nav_menu()` on primary blog/site to output through the widget.

Great for footer or sidebar menus that can be managed from one place and distributed throughout the network.

_Tested on WP 3.9.1_
